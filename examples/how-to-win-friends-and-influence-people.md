The book is dedicated to Homer Croy, Dale Carnegie's cherished friend, signifying the importance of friendship and personal connection, a theme that resonates throughout the book. Initially published in 1936, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" has sold over ten million copies and has been translated into thirty-six languages, demonstrating its enduring appeal and universal relevance.

### Preface and Carnegie's Revision Philosophy

The Preface to the Revised Edition highlights the **enduring success** and **relevance** of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," initially published in 1937\. Despite its immediate popularity and status as an international bestseller, Dale Carnegie believed in **continuous revision and modernization**. This preface addresses the question of why a successful book needs revision.

Carnegie's **revision philosophy** stemmed from his use of the book as a textbook for his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations. He constantly updated his courses to meet the evolving needs of his audience. He recognized that examples and language could become dated, diminishing the book's impact. Therefore, the revisions aimed to clarify and strengthen the book for modern readers without altering its core content.

The revised edition retains Carnegie's **original style** and voice, characterized by a brash, breezy, and conversational manner. While some outdated references and phrases have been updated, the essence of Carnegie's writing remains intact. The goal was to hone and polish a finely made tool, ensuring its continued effectiveness in helping people improve their lives. The enduring success of the book and the growing popularity of Carnegie courses demonstrate the timelessness of his principles.

### The Genesis of the Book: Research and Development

The chapter "How This Book Was Written \- And Why" details the **research** and development process behind "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Dale Carnegie identified a need for a **practical handbook** on **human relations**, noting that while numerous books were published annually, few addressed the crucial skills of interacting effectively with others. This realization stemmed from his experience conducting courses for business professionals, where he observed that **human engineering** skills – **personality** and **leadership** – were as vital, if not more so, than technical expertise.

Carnegie's **research** involved extensive **interviews** with successful individuals across various fields, from inventors like Marconi and Edison to political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also hired a researcher to delve into libraries, examining biographies and psychological studies to uncover effective techniques for winning friends and influencing people. This comprehensive approach aimed to identify principles that had stood the test of time.

The book evolved from a short talk Carnegie gave in his courses at the Carnegie Institute. He encouraged his students to test these principles in their daily lives and report back on their experiences. This iterative process, spanning fifteen years, transformed a simple set of rules into a comprehensive guide, validated by the experiences of thousands of adults. The book's principles are designed to inspire **enthusiasm** and teamwork, turning potential adversaries into allies.

Carnegie emphasized the importance of these skills by referencing a study by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which found that 85% of one's financial success is due to skill in human engineering, while only 15% is due to technical knowledge. He also included John D. Rockefeller's quote, stating that "the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee," and that he would "pay more for that ability than for any other under the sun." This underscores the immense value Carnegie placed on mastering human relations.

### Maximizing the Book's Impact: Nine Suggestions

To maximize the benefits derived from "How to Win Friends and Influence People," Carnegie outlines nine actionable suggestions. These suggestions emphasize active engagement with the material, diligent application of principles, and a commitment to continuous self-improvement.

The most indispensable requirement for benefiting from the book is a deep, driving **desire to learn** and a vigorous determination to increase one's ability to deal with people. Without this fundamental requisite, all other techniques will avail little. This desire can be cultivated by constantly reminding oneself of the importance of these principles and visualizing how their mastery will lead to a richer, happier, and more fulfilling life.

Carnegie recommends readers engage with the material actively in several ways. First, he advises reading each chapter rapidly to gain an overview, followed by a thorough reread for deeper understanding. He stresses the importance of **diligent application**, urging readers to stop frequently to contemplate how and when they can apply each suggestion. To further enhance engagement, Carnegie suggests reading with a crayon, pencil, or highlighter, marking and underscoring key suggestions for easy review. This active marking makes the book more interesting and facilitates rapid review.Furthermore, Carnegie emphasizes the importance of **active practice**. He quotes Bernard Shaw, stating, "If you teach a man anything, he will never learn." Learning is an active process, and mastery requires doing. Readers are encouraged to apply the principles at every opportunity, recognizing that forming new habits and adopting a new way of life requires time, persistence, and daily application. He suggests regarding the book as a working handbook on human relations, consulting it whenever confronted with specific problems.

The **self-assessment** and **continuous improvement** process is a cornerstone of Carnegie's approach. He recounts the story of a Wall Street bank president who used a highly efficient system for self-improvement. This man kept an engagement book, reviewing his interviews, discussions, and meetings each Saturday evening. He asked himself what mistakes he made, what he did right, and what lessons he could learn. This weekly review, Carnegie suggests, is invaluable for improving one's ability to make decisions and interact with people.

The **engagement book system** is a method for self-examination and review. It involves keeping a detailed record of daily interactions and setting aside time each week to analyze one's performance. This system aids self-improvement by identifying mistakes, reinforcing positive actions, and extracting valuable lessons from experience. Carnegie encourages readers to adopt a similar system to track their application of the book's principles.

Finally, Carnegie suggests making the learning process more engaging by offering a spouse, child, or business associate a small reward each time they catch you violating a principle. He also recommends keeping a record of triumphs in applying the principles, noting specific names, dates, and results. This record serves as a source of inspiration and a testament to the transformative power of the book's teachings.

### Principle 1: Avoiding Criticism, Condemnation, and Complaining

Principle 1 of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is: "Don't criticize, condemn, or complain." Carnegie argues that **criticism**, **condemnation**, and **complaining** are generally ineffective in changing behavior and often lead to negative outcomes.

To illustrate the futility of criticism, Carnegie uses the examples of notorious criminals such as "Two Gun" Crowley, Al Capone, and Dutch Schultz. Even these individuals, despite their heinous acts, did not blame themselves. Crowley, a cop killer, saw himself as having "a weary heart, but a kind one." Al Capone, the infamous Chicago gangster, considered himself a public benefactor. Dutch Schultz, another notorious criminal, also viewed himself as a public benefactor. These examples highlight the human tendency to **rationalization**, even among those who commit serious offenses.

Carnegie cites Lewis Lawes, the warden of Sing Sing prison for many years, who observed that few criminals regard themselves as bad men. Instead, they **rationalize** their actions, justifying their antisocial behavior even to themselves. They maintain that they should never have been imprisoned at all. This illustrates that even those who are clearly in the wrong often avoid self-blame and instead seek to justify their actions.

Criticism is generally ineffective in changing behavior because it puts a person on the **defensive behavior** and often makes them strive to justify themselves. It wounds a person's precious pride, hurts their sense of importance, and arouses **resentment**. B.F. Skinner's experiments demonstrated that animals learn more effectively when rewarded for good behavior than when punished for bad behavior. This principle applies to humans as well. Criticism does not lead to lasting changes and often incurs resentment.

According to Hans Selye, another great psychologist, "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation." The **resentment** that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members, and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

Carnegie provides the example of George B. Johnston, a safety coordinator for an engineering company, who initially used an authoritative approach to enforce the wearing of hard hats. This resulted in sullen acceptance and frequent removal of the hats after he left. However, when Johnston switched to a more empathetic approach, asking about discomfort and reminding the workers of the hat's protective function, compliance increased without resentment.

**Empathy** and **understanding** are crucial in avoiding criticism and offering constructive feedback. By trying to see the situation from the other person's perspective, one can avoid making them defensive and more receptive to change. Instead of criticizing, one can offer suggestions and support that help them improve.

Theodore Roosevelt's criticism of President Taft, which split the Republican party, and the Teapot Dome oil scandal, where Albert B. Fall blamed everyone but himself, further illustrate the futility of criticism. Even when individuals are clearly at fault, criticism rarely leads to repentance or change.

Therefore, to foster positive relationships and influence people effectively, it is essential to avoid criticism, condemnation, and complaining. Instead, focus on understanding, empathy, and offering constructive support.

### Principle 2: Giving Honest and Sincere Appreciation

Principle 2 of Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" emphasizes the power of "Give honest and sincere appreciation." This principle underscores the fundamental human **desire for importance**, a craving so profound that satisfying it can unlock remarkable potential in others. William James, a renowned psychologist, highlighted this, stating, "The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated."

Why is the desire for a feeling of importance a fundamental human need? Because it is a core element of our identity and self-worth. It distinguishes us from animals and drives us to achieve, create, and contribute. When this need is met, it fosters enthusiasm, loyalty, and a willingness to excel.

Sincere praise addresses this need directly. Examples abound of individuals driven by this desire. Abraham Lincoln, initially a poverty-stricken grocery clerk, pursued law fueled by a desire for significance. Charles Dickens penned immortal novels, and Rockefeller amassed a fortune, all driven by this fundamental human need. Even figures like George Washington and Columbus sought titles and recognition to amplify their sense of importance.

However, it's crucial to distinguish between **appreciation** and **flattery**. While both involve positive words, their intent and impact differ vastly. Appreciation is genuine, heartfelt, and unselfish, stemming from sincere admiration for someone's qualities or actions. Flattery, on the other hand, is insincere, shallow, and self-serving, often used to manipulate or gain favor. As General Alvaro Obregon wisely stated, "Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you."

Charles Schwab, one of the first American business executives to earn over a million dollars annually, attributed his success to his ability to **arouse enthusiasm** in his employees through **appreciation** and **encouragement**. He believed that criticism stifles ambition, while sincere praise inspires greater effort. Schwab famously said, "I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement."

The story of the six red roses illustrates the transformative power of appreciation. A man, prompted by his wife's self-improvement group, initially considered listing her flaws. Instead, he sent her six red roses with a note expressing his love and appreciation for her as she was. This simple act of **positive reinforcement** not only deeply touched his wife but also garnered admiration from others, highlighting the profound impact of sincere appreciation.

In contrast to Schwab's approach, criticism can be detrimental. It puts people on the defensive, wounds their pride, and arouses resentment. Even figures like "Two Gun" Crowley and Al Capone rationalized their actions, highlighting the futility of criticism in fostering self-awareness or change.

Therefore, the key lies in offering honest and sincere appreciation, focusing on specific qualities and achievements rather than resorting to empty flattery. By satisfying the desire for importance, we can unlock potential, foster enthusiasm, and build strong, positive relationships.

### Principle 3: Arousing in the Other Person an Eager Want

Principle 3, "Arouse in the other person an eager want," emphasizes the power of understanding and appealing to **self-interest** to motivate others. It suggests that instead of focusing on what you want, you should focus on what the other person wants and then show them how achieving your goals will also help them achieve theirs. This principle is rooted in the idea that people are primarily motivated by their own desires and aspirations.

Why is it more effective to talk about what others want than what you want? Because people are inherently **ego-centric**. As Harry A. Overstreet noted, "Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire." Therefore, the key to **persuasion** lies in arousing in the other person an **eager want**.

Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during World War I, understood this principle well. He attributed his political longevity to his ability to "bait the hook to suit the fish," meaning he tailored his appeals to resonate with the desires of his audience. Similarly, Emerson and Carnegie used this principle to motivate their family members. Emerson's housemaid knew to appeal to a calf's desire to suckle, while Carnegie motivated his nephews by appealing to their desire for money.

How can you connect your goals to the other person's values and aspirations? By understanding their perspective and framing your requests in terms of their **values** and **aspirations**. This requires empathy and a genuine interest in what matters to them.

Harry A. Overstreet's advice encapsulates this principle: "First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way." This highlights the importance of understanding what others fundamentally desire and then aligning your goals with those desires.

The story of Stan Novak and his son Tim vividly illustrates this principle. Tim was reluctant to start kindergarten, so Stan and his wife focused on what Tim wanted: fun, friends, and exciting activities. They created a finger-painting session at home, emphasizing that kindergarten was the gateway to learning such skills. This **motivation** transformed Tim's reluctance into an **eager want**, leading him to eagerly await his first day.

What is the "Ego-Centric Universe" framework, and how does it relate to this principle? The "Ego-Centric Universe" framework suggests that individuals view the world primarily from their own perspective, with their own needs and desires at the center. This principle aligns with this framework by acknowledging that people are most receptive to messages that directly address their self-interest.

How did Stan Novak use this principle to help his son start kindergarten? By shifting the focus from his desire for Tim to attend kindergarten to Tim's own desires for fun and new experiences. He created an environment that made kindergarten seem appealing, thereby arousing an **eager want** in Tim.In essence, Principle 3 advocates for a shift in perspective, urging us to understand and appeal to the desires of others to achieve our own goals effectively.

### Part Two Overview: Making People Like You \- Interest and Smiles

Part Two of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" shifts focus to the art of making people like you. Carnegie asserts that the key to **friendliness** and building **rapport** lies in genuinely focusing on others, rather than trying to make them focus on you. This section emphasizes the importance of showing **genuine interest** in other people and the power of a **smile** in making a good **first impression**.

Carnegie illustrates the concept of **genuine interest** by pointing to dogs, who effortlessly make friends by showing sincere enthusiasm and affection. Dogs don't try to impress; they simply express their delight in others, a trait that humans often overlook. This simple act of showing you care is more effective than any attempt to get others interested in you.

Answering the question of how to make friends quickly and easily, Carnegie emphasizes the importance of becoming genuinely interested in other people. He cites Alfred Adler, the Viennese psychologist, who stated that individuals who lack interest in others face the greatest difficulties in life and cause the most harm. This underscores the idea that focusing on others is not just a social skill but a fundamental aspect of a fulfilling life.

The module also highlights the power of a **smile**. Charles Schwab is quoted as saying that his smile was worth a million dollars, emphasizing its immense value in building relationships and creating a positive **first impression**. A smile conveys liking, happiness, and gladness, fostering immediate **rapport** and **friendliness**. It's a simple yet profound way to make people feel valued and appreciated.

Answering the question of why genuine interest in others is more effective than trying to get others interested in you, Carnegie explains that people are inherently self-centered. They are primarily interested in themselves, their wants, and their problems. Therefore, showing genuine interest in their lives and concerns is the most effective way to connect with them and build lasting relationships.

Finally, answering the question of how a smile contributes to making a good first impression, Carnegie explains that a smile communicates positive emotions and creates an immediate sense of connection. It signals that you are approachable, friendly, and genuinely pleased to meet the other person, setting the stage for a positive interaction.

### Part Two: Remembering Names and Active Listening

Continuing the exploration of "Ways to Make People Like You," this module delves into the crucial skills of **remembering names** and practicing **active listening**. Carnegie emphasizes that these skills are essential for building strong relationships and fostering effective **communication**.

The importance of **remembering names** is highlighted through the example of Jim Farley, a prominent political figure known for his ability to recall thousands of people's names. This ability was instrumental in building relationships and securing political support. Remembering a person's name is a subtle yet powerful way of showing respect and making them feel valued. It creates an immediate connection and demonstrates that you care about them as an individual.

Answering the question of why remembering a person's name is so important in building relationships, Carnegie emphasizes that a person's name is the sweetest and most important sound to them. Remembering and using their name makes them feel recognized, valued, and important, fostering a sense of connection and goodwill.

Napoleon III's technique for **remembering names** is detailed as a practical method for improving name recall. This technique involves actively focusing on the name, repeating it several times during the conversation, and associating it with the person's features and characteristics. This active engagement helps to solidify the name in your memory.

The module then transitions to the importance of **active listening**, citing Charles W. Eliot's view on the value of exclusive attention. Eliot believed that giving undivided attention to the speaker is the highest form of flattery. **Active listening** involves not just hearing the words but also understanding the speaker's emotions and perspective. It requires **empathy**, patience, and a genuine desire to understand the other person's point of view.

Answering the question of what techniques can be used to improve name recall, the module highlights Napoleon III's method of repetition, association, and written reinforcement. These techniques involve actively engaging with the name and creating mental cues to aid in recall.

The story of the New York Telephone Company's "troubleshooter" illustrates the power of **active listening** in resolving conflicts and building customer loyalty. By patiently listening to a disgruntled customer's complaints and showing genuine **empathy**, the troubleshooter was able to de-escalate the situation and turn an angry customer into a satisfied one.

Answering the question of how **active listening** contributes to effective **communication** and building **rapport**, the module explains that it demonstrates respect, understanding, and a genuine interest in the other person's perspective. This fosters trust, strengthens relationships, and creates a more positive and productive **communication** environment.

### Part Two: Talking Interests and Making Others Feel Important

Concluding Part Two, this module focuses on the principles of talking in terms of the other person's **self-interest** and making the other person feel **important**. Carnegie argues that these principles are essential for building strong relationships and influencing others positively.

The importance of talking in terms of the other person's **self-interest** is illustrated through the example of Theodore Roosevelt, who meticulously prepared for visitors by studying their interests. By engaging in conversations about topics that were meaningful to his guests, Roosevelt made them feel valued and created a strong connection. This demonstrates the power of **perspective-taking** and **empathy** in building **rapport**.

Answering the question of why it is important to talk in terms of the other person's interests, Carnegie explains that people are primarily motivated by their own desires and concerns. By focusing on what matters to them, you capture their attention, demonstrate that you value their perspective, and create a more engaging and meaningful interaction.

The module then delves into the significance of making others feel **important**, citing John Dewey's view on the fundamental human desire to be **important**. This desire drives much of human behavior, and satisfying it is a key to building strong relationships. Showing **appreciation** and **recognition** for others' contributions and accomplishments is a powerful way to make them feel valued and respected.

The story of the letter to the twelve banks in Phoenix illustrates the effectiveness of focusing on the other person's needs. Instead of highlighting her own qualifications, Barbara Anderson emphasized how her skills could benefit the banks, resulting in multiple interview offers.

Answering the question of how you can make others feel important and valued, the module emphasizes the importance of sincere **appreciation**, **recognition**, and genuine interest in their lives and accomplishments. This can be achieved through active listening, thoughtful gestures, and by acknowledging their unique contributions.

The "Ego-Centric Universe" framework is introduced, highlighting the idea that each person views the world primarily from their own perspective. Understanding this framework is crucial for applying the principle of making others feel **important**. By recognizing that everyone is the center of their own universe, you can tailor your interactions to resonate with their individual needs and desires.

Answering the question of what the "Ego-Centric Universe" framework is and how it relates to this principle, the module explains that it is the understanding that each person is the center of their own universe. By understanding this, you can tailor your interactions to resonate with their individual needs and desires, making them feel valued and important.

### Part Three Overview: Winning People to Your Way of Thinking \- Avoiding Arguments

Part Three of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" shifts the focus to "How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking." This section emphasizes the importance of **persuasion** and **diplomacy** over confrontation. A central theme is the ineffectiveness of **arguments** in changing someone's mind. Instead, Carnegie advocates for understanding and respecting the **opinions** of others.

Arguing, according to Carnegie, is generally a losing proposition. Even if you "win" an argument, you often lose the other person's **good will**. People are naturally defensive about their beliefs, and direct confrontation tends to solidify their positions rather than open them to new perspectives. It can lead to resentment and damage relationships. The "Honey vs. Gall" Principle, though not explicitly named in this section, is implied: sweetness and understanding are more effective than bitterness and confrontation.

The story of Patrick J. O'Haire serves as a powerful example. O'Haire, initially an argumentative salesman, transformed his approach after learning the principles of human relations. He realized that winning arguments was costing him sales. By adopting a more agreeable and understanding demeanor, he became a successful salesman.

Ben Franklin's quote, though not explicitly mentioned in this section, is a guiding principle: "If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will." This underscores the importance of **good will** in effective communication and influence.

Why is arguing generally ineffective in changing someone's mind? Arguing puts people on the defensive, wounds their pride, and makes them strive to justify themselves. It rarely leads to lasting changes in belief.

How can showing respect for others' opinions lead to more effective communication? Showing respect creates a more receptive environment for influence. When people feel understood and valued, they are more likely to consider alternative viewpoints.

What is the "Honey vs. Gall" Principle, and how does it relate to this section? The "Honey vs. Gall" Principle suggests that a gentle, persuasive approach (honey) is more effective than a harsh, confrontational one (gall). This principle is central to Part Three, as it advocates for avoiding arguments and instead using diplomacy and understanding to win people over.

### Part Three: Admitting Mistakes and Starting Friendly

Continuing the exploration of "How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking," Part Three emphasizes the power of **humility** and **friendliness**. It highlights the importance of **admitting mistakes** and beginning interactions in a **friendly** way to foster **rapport** and open communication.

Admitting when you're wrong, even when difficult, is presented as a strength, not a weakness. It disarms the other person and creates an atmosphere of trust and **conciliation**.
